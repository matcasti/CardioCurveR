Description: CardioCurveR is an R package that automates the estimation of nonlinear models for characterizing R-R interval (RRi) fluctuations in cardiovascular monitoring. The package fits logistic-type curves to RRi data collected during rest, exercise, and recovery, using robust optimization methods such as the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (with optional Bayesian estimation via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). It provides a suite of functions for model fitting, diagnostic visualization, and parameter interpretation, making it an invaluable tool for researchers and clinicians in the field of cardiovascular health.
